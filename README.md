Introduction
============

The Government Data Architecture Community (GDAC) is a cross-government collaborative network and related sub-groups (smaller communities of practice) that brings together anyone who works in or around the field of data architecture in local, regional, devolved and central government. We discuss good practice, challenges that we currently face and work together as data architects towards better data-sharing and interoperability throughout government.

GDAC currently has four sub-groups which operate as smaller communities of practice collaborating around specific challenges to data-sharing and interoperability across government:

- Business glossaries
- Metadata
- Data standards
- Data modelling

The GDAC Business Glossary Sub-group aims to establish a common understanding of terms used by the community of data management professionals. This document is not intended to be an official, authoritative nor complete set of terms and their associated definitions, but rather a shared asset to encourage contributions, discussion, debate and engagement from the wider community.

The vocabulary is available as a [Turtle file](https://github.com/gdac/business-glossary/blob/gh-pages/terms.ttl) from the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gdac/business-glossary). For additional details on how this documentation was created and is maintained, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gdac/business-glossary/tree/gh-pages/src).

Contributing
============
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gdac/business-glossary/issues) are preferred for feedback and discussion of terms.
